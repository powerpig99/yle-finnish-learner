# Privacy Policy - YLE Dual Subtitles Extension

**Last updated:** November 2025

## Overview

YLE Dual Subtitles Extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser:

- **DeepL API Tokens:** Stored locally using Chrome's sync storage API. Tokens are only used to authenticate requests to DeepL's translation service.
- **Translated Subtitles:** Cached locally in your browser's IndexedDB to avoid re-translating previously watched content.
- **User Preferences:** Extension settings are stored locally in your browser.

## Data Transmission

This extension only communicates with the following external service:

- **DeepL API** (api-free.deepl.com): Finnish subtitle text is sent to DeepL for translation to target language (English, Vietnamese). This is the core functionality of the extension. Your own API key is used for authentication. See DeepL's privacy policy at https://www.deepl.com/privacy

## Data Collection

This extension does **NOT** collect:

- Personal identification information
- Browsing history
- Location data
- Financial information
- Authentication credentials (other than your self-provided DeepL API token)
- Any analytics or usage data

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service used is DeepL for translation. We do not control DeepL's data practices. Please review their privacy policy for information on how they handle data.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or transfer any user data to third parties.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in this document with an updated date.
