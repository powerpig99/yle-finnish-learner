What's new in v6.0.0:
• Zero external dependencies — no build step, no npm packages, pure source JS
• Owned MP3 encoder replaces external library (lamejs/shine)
• Removed TypeScript compilation — source loads directly in Chrome
• Codebase reduced 26% (~5,400 lines removed) through recursive dead code audit
• All existing features preserved: dual subtitles, popup dictionary, playback controls, audio download
